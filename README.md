# VOID206551

## Working On
I'm currently working on a Discord bot, [Melody](https://melody.void206551.dev). 
 * Melody is a simple Discord chat bot that is made with Discord.js and is in over 100 servers.
 
 I've developed an API to get topics, roasts, toasts, pickup lines, and jokes. 
 * [NPM package](https://void206551.dev/projects/fun-responses)
 * [PyPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/fun-responses/)
 * [Browser Module](https://github.com/void206551/fun-responses-browser)
 

**If you find a bug in any of these projects, please open an issue on the relevant page.**
