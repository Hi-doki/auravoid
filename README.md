## About Me
Hi! You're stopping by my account! That's pretty cool, I guess. Anyways, I'm Jason. I started coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript just a couple years ago. I enjoy what I do and I'm always willing to learn more. 

## Working On
I'm currently working on a Discord bot, [Melody](https://melody.void206551.dev). 
 > Melody is a simple chat bot with a few amount of commands right now. Melody is made with Discord.js and is hosted on Heroku.
 
 I've developed an API to get topics, roasts, toasts, pickup lines, and jokes.
