## About Me
Hi! You're stopping by my account! That's pretty cool, I guess. Anyways, I'm Jason. I started coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript just a couple years ago. I enjoy what I do and I'm always willing to learn more. 

## Working On
I'm currently working on a Discord bot, [Melody](https://github.com/void-melody/melody). 
 > Melody is a simple chat bot with a few amount of commands right now. Melody is made with Discord.js and is hosted on Heroku.
 
 I'm developing a NPM package to send pickup lines, jokes, topics, roasts, and toasts. You can find that [here](https://void206551.github.io/fun-responses/)
 > It's still in development so it may be a bit buggy. 
 
 I was working on [YTDL-CLI](https://github.com/void206551/ytdl-cli).
  > Its releases support both Linux and Windows. 
 
## Contact Methods
Since I am 15-years-old, most of my information is somewhat privated. If you do want to contact me, please contact me on Discord (`void206551#6669`).
